### Experience

**[SwiftServe](http://www.swiftserve.com/en/) UK (remotely)** Senior Developer,
Dec 2015 — Jul 2016.

I was responsible for maintaining and developing three internal services written
in Python + Django. We had micro-service architecture with REST interface. The
most important service was hosted in AWS.

I've prepared AWS stack and such automation tools as Bash/Python scripts and
Ansible roles. We used Docker in AWS. I set up new documentation system and
modern test framework to develop unit tests rapidly.

**[Dataart](http://www.dataart.com/)** Senior Developer, 2013 — 2015.

The main project I've been working on in Dataart was a world-wide online
game. Its audience is about 70 million players. I was working on a web-portal
(Django) and three internal REST services (Falcon, Flask).

The infrastructure involved lots of HTTP APIs, Celery tasks and message queues
(RabbitMQ, Kafka). I have written lots of unit tests. The front-end part was
implemented with our custom JS framework built upon Backbone.js + helper
libraries.

**[Energosbyt](http://e-sbyt.ru/)**, Senior Developer, 2010 — 2013.

I supported a vast application for selling electricity to our clients. I created
an online service for customers. I integrated the application with SMS gateway
and Google services. I created a [mobile application][mobile application] for
Android.

**Web studio**, Developer, 2007 — 2010.

I worked on sites built on PHP CMS and flash-animation.

### Education

Bachelor Degree in Applied Informatics in Economics,
[Chita University of Economics](http://narhoz-chita.ru/), 2003 -- 2008

Currently, I'm getting Master Degree in Computer Science,
[Voronezh State University](http://www.vsu.ru/), 2015 -- now

### Projects

[Queryfeed](https://queryfeed.net/) — my own project. It's an online service to
fetch posts from Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Instagram. It's build on Clojure
plus Ring and handles about **6 millions** requests a day. There is a paid
subscription via Paypal.

[F — Python library][url-f] for functional programming. In that library, I
collected a bunch of functions and classes to bring functional style of
programming in Python programming language. The ideas were taken mainly from
Clojure and Scala. At the moment of writing the project has almost 100 stars on
Github. There is a [post][url-f-habr] written in Russian about the project.

### Volunteering

I created a bunch of lessons about Python for educational project "Hexlet" (the
audience are native Russian speakers in general). Each lesson consist of a video
lecture, a test and a practical task. The [first course][py-1], the
[second course][py-2].

Every month I give speeches about programming in our local community.
