## Experience

### 2016 &mdash; now: Clojure developer @ [Flyerbee](https://www.flyerbee.com/) (Switzerland)

Flyerbee is a web app that automates outdooring advertisement. I worked on both
server and UI parts of it using modified Liminus stack. It includes Clojure,
Ring, JDBC/PostgreSQL, Re-frame.

### 2015 &mdash; 2016: Python developer @ [SwiftServe](http://www.swiftserve.com/) (UK)

SwiftServe is a world-wide CDN network that competes with AWS CloudFront. I
developed three internal services written in Python and Django and set up
micro-service architecture in AWS cloud. I integrated modern unit-test framework
into our pipeline and added a new documentation system.

### 2013 &mdash; 2015: Python developer @ [Dataart](http://www.dataart.com/)

DataArt is a vast outsourcing company. The main project I've been working on was
a world-wide online game with 70M players. I developed several internal
services, set up message queues and wrote lots of unit tests.

### 2008 &mdash; 2013: Various contracting jobs

I've been working on various projects including PHP, Java and Delphi. My clients
were mostly individuals and mid companies. I used to develop desktop apps,
online services and Android applications.

### Education

Bachelor Degree at Applied Informatics in
Economics, [Chita University of Economics](http://narhoz-chita.ru/), 2003 --
2008

### Own Projects and Open source

- [Queryfeed](https://queryfeed.net/) is an app to grab data from social
  networks using the official API and scrapping methods. It serves over 6M
  requests a day. There is a paid subscription with Paypal. Clojure, Datomic.

- [Etaoin][etaoin] is a Clojure library for browser automation. It relies on
  pure [Webdriver protocol][webdriver] and does not need installing
  Selenimum. In Flyerbee, I used it to write UI tests for our SPA application.

- [F â€” Python library][f] for functional programming. It's a set of functions
  and collections borrowed mostly from Clojure, Scala and Haskell.

- Python lessons for educational project [Hexlet][hexlet] (in Russian,
  [first][py-1], [second][py-2] courses). I've made 15 classes in total, each
  consists of a video, a quiz and a practical task.

### Other

I am a father of two. Enjoy winter activities. Run my [blog][blog] in both
English and Russian. Willing to publish my own Clojure book one day. Here are
some Clojure-related posts in English:
