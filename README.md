**Experience**

*[SwiftServe](http://www.swiftserve.com/en/), UK (remotely), Dec 2015 —  Jul 2016*

I was responsible for maintaining and developing three internal services written
in Python + Django. We had micro-service architecture with REST interface. The
most important service was hosted in AWS.

I've prepared AWS stack and automation tools such as scripts and Ansible
roles. We used Docker in AWS. I set up new documentation system and modern test
framework to develop tests rapidly.

*Dataart, Voronezh, Senior Developer, 2013 — 2015*

The main project I've been working on in Dataart was a world-wide online
game. Its audience is about 70 million players. I was working on a web-portal
(Django) and three internal REST services (Falcon, Flask). The infrastructure
involved lots of HTTP APIs, Celery tasks and message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka). I
have written lots of unit tests.

The front-end part was implemented with our custom JS framework built upon
Backbone.js + helper libraries.

an online service for customers. I integrated the application with SMS gateway
and Google services. I created a [mobile application][mobile application] for
Android.
