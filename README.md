I developed three internal services written in Python and Django and set up
micro-service architecture in AWS cloud. I integrated modern unit-test framework
and documentation system.

The main project I was engaged in was a world-wide online game with 70M
players. I developed several internal services, set up message queues and wrote
lots of unit tests.

Python lessons for educational project [Hexlet][hexlet]
([first][py-1], [second][py-2] courses). I've made 15 classes in total, each
consists of a video, a quiz and a practical task.

### Open source

[Etaoin][etaoin] is a Clojure library for browser automation. It relies on
pure [Webdriver protocol][webdriver] and does not need installing Selenimum. In
Flyerbee, we use it to write UI tests against our SPA application.

[F â€” Python library][f] for functional programming. It's a set of functions and
collections borrowed mostly from Clojure, Scala and Haskell.

I am a father of two. Enjoy winter activities. Run my [blog][blog] in both
English and Russian. Willing to publish my own Clojure book one day.
