**Experience**

*[SwiftServe](http://www.swiftserve.com/en/), UK (remotely), Dec 2015 — Jul
2016*

I was responsible for maintaining and developing three internal services written
in Python + Django. We had micro-service architecture with REST interface. The
most important service was hosted in AWS.

I've prepared AWS stack and such automation tools as Bash/Python scripts and
Ansible roles. We used Docker in AWS. I set up new documentation system and
modern test framework to develop unit tests rapidly.

*Dataart, Voronezh, Senior Developer, 2013 — 2015*

The main project I've been working on in Dataart was a world-wide online
game. Its audience is about 70 million players. I was working on a web-portal
(Django) and three internal REST services (Falcon, Flask). The infrastructure
involved lots of HTTP APIs, Celery tasks and message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka). I
have written lots of unit tests.

The front-end part was implemented with our custom JS framework built upon
Backbone.js + helper libraries.

*Energosbyt, Chita, Developer, 2010 — 2013*

I supported a vast application for selling electricity to our clients. I created
an online service for customers. I integrated the application with SMS gateway
and Google services. I created a [mobile application][mobile application] for
Android.
